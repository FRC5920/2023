# Third Party Code

This directory contains modules and files taken from other teams or online
sources.  It's important that FRC Team 5290 does not take credit for work we did
not do ourselves.  Therefore, files placed in this folder **must** be properly
credited to their original author/team/source via code comments or other means.
Additionally, any licenses that apply to third party code modules must be
included when they are required.
