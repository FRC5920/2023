# Autonomous Routine Naming Conventions

The following nomenclature conventions are observed in descriptions of 2023
autonomous routines.  These conventions supplement but do not override 
[typical FRC coordinate system conventions](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/geometry/coordinate-systems.html).

## Directions

No matter which Alliance is active, the following conventions for directions are
observed:

- North is the direction moving away from the Scoring Table
- South is the direction moving toward the Scoring Table
- Gridward is the direction moving toward the Grids of the active alliance
- Fieldward is the direction moving toward the center of the field

## Substation Grids

- Substation Grids in the the community are given designators A-I.
- Grid A is always the Southernmost position (i.e. closest to the scoring table).
- Grid I is always the Northernmost position (i.e. furthest from the scoring table).

## Preset Game Pieces

Regardless of Alliance, preset game pieces on the field are enumerated `C1`
through `C4`:

- `C1` is the Northernmost game piece.
- `C4` is the Southernmost game piece.
