# Auto-Builder: Generated Autonomous Routines

The AutoBuilder is a set of modules that interpret a set of Dashboard elements
(widgets) offering choices for where the robot should move and what it should do
during the autonomous period.  The values of Dashboard widgets values are passed
to AutoBuilder code modules, that generate corresponding trajectories to move
the robot along the selected path and combine them with commands used to carry
out other behaviors including shooting cargo and balancing.

The Auto-Builder is intended to provide the robot drive team with a flexible set
of options during the autonomous period, enabling them to work alongside the
autonomous routines of other alliance robots.  Choice widgets used to build auto
routines include:
