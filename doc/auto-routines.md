# 2023 Autonomous Routines

FRC 5290: VIKotics

## Autonomous Routine Conventions

![Auto Routine Conventions Illustration](./_auto-routines/auto-conventions.svg "Conventions for autonomous routines")

### Directions

No matter which Alliance is active, the following conventions apply:

- North is the direction moving away from the Scoring Table
- South is the direction moving toward the Scoring Table
- Gridward is the direction moving toward the Grids of the active alliance
- Fieldward is the direction moving toward the center of the field

### Grids

- Grids in the the community are assigned designators A-I.
- Grid A is always the one on the side closest to the scoring table

### Lanes

- The space in the community surrounding the Charging Station is divided in
half to produce two distinct lanes:
-- The __Inner__ lane wraps around the Charging Station
-- The __Outer__ lane follows the edge of the field next to the scoring table,
the Grids, and the divider.
